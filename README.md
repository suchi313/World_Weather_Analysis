# World Weather Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this challenge was to collect, analyze, and visualize weather data from cities across the world. After analyzing the information, I was able to create an interactive map to help a travel planning agency. The agency leveraged the tool to provide guidance to clients as they selected their ideal vacations.The agency was also able to create a unique experience for each client by creating a individualized vacation itinerary. 

## Weather Database
The challenge asked to create a random set of 2,000 Latitudes + Longitudes. After the list was created, we had to make an API Call by using Google Maps. 

The following list of data was received:
1. Latitude and Longitutde 
2. Maximum Temperature 
3. % Humidity 
4. % Cloudiness 
5. Wind Speed 
6. Current Weather Description

## Vacation Itinerary 

Utlizing Google Directions API, I created a sample itinerary of how to use the interactive tooL. For this example, I chose four cities across the southern edge of New Zealand. As shown in the images below, it provides travelers an overarching view of cities they can visit, the distances, the weather, and various hotel accoumadations that can be offered.
